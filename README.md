## Description
This is a Python package created by the members of RobÃ´CIn robotics team
from the Informatics Centre of the Federal University of Pernambuco, CIn - UFPE.
It's purpose is to provide a building block for data science inside the 
2D Simulation, Very Small Size Soccer(VSS) and Small Size League (SSL) 
environments using logfiles generated by each of the categories.

### Dependencies
This project was created with:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.x or above
    - Used to create common classes, structures and algorithms that provides 
    analysis.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 1.2.4 or above
    - Provides a simple structure to manipulate all the data gathered. 
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) 1.20.3 or above

### Setup
You must install this project as a Python package. So to install it
on your machine or virtual environment use setup.py outside the module as:

```
$ cd path/to/SoccerAnalyzer
$ mv SoccerAnalyzer/setup.py .
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install
```
## Getting Started
This package is capable of delivering built-in analysis that were already
created or to be a platform that enables you to create your own analysis.

### Using as analyzer
##### How it works?
Each analysis is a class, they are instantiated by a [factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)
which is the **common.utility.match_analyzer** module. He is responsible for
creating each object of the analysis.

When an analysis is instantiated, it builds itself and gathers eveything that is
needed to provide the analysis information. This information is stored in the factory and can be
accessed through the **MatchAnalyzer.collect()** method. 

The **MatchAnalyzer** receives a **Match** object as parameter.

The **Match** receives a **pandas.DataFrame** object as parameter.

These inputs are **mandatory**, otherwise there will be no data to be analyzed.

##### 2D Simulation code example

```python
import pandas as pd

from SoccerAnalyzer.common.utility.match_analyzer import MatchAnalyzer
from SoccerAnalyzer.common.basic.match import Match

logfile_path = "location/to/log/file.csv"
dataframe = pd.read_csv(logfile_path)

match_object = Match(dataframe)
match_analyzer = MatchAnalyzer(match_object)
match_analyzer.collect()
```
